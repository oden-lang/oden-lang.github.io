I have the pleasure of presenting Oden at a number of conferences this year.
The talks will cover the background, motivation, goals, and current state
of Oden.

* [PolyConf (June 30 &mdash; July 2)](http://polyconf.com/)
* [Curry On Rome (July 18 &mdash; July 19)](http://curry-on.org/2016/)
* [LambdaWorld (September 30 &mdash; October 1)](http://www.lambda.world/)

I hope to meet many programmers out there and get feedback on this project.
I'm sure it will be a lot of fun!
