This week I got a request for a documented overview of the compiler and how it
integrates with the Go compiler and runtime. I have just written the starting
point of such a document and added it to the Oden repository. If you're
interested, have a look at
[doc/compiler-overview.md](https://github.com/oden-lang/oden/blob/master/doc/compiler-overview.md#compiler-overview).

If you have any suggestions please post them as GitHub issues. Other cheerful
comments are welcome here or at Twitter. üôèüèæ

I will probably add a small guide on how to get started hacking on Oden as
well. This is not a huge topic, the project is pretty much a standard Stack
setup, with the exception of requiring a Go installation. Nonetheless, if the
learning curve for an aspiring contributor can be lowered, it is worth working
at.
